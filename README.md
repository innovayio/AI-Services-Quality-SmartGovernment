# AI4SmartGovernment
#### In a pursuit to enhance the quality of the governmental services to citizens, monitoring and analyzing citizens and community feedback is key to understand pitfalls and areas of enhancements. Over past years, manual efforts to monitor such feedback proved very sounding results in discovering anomalies, rumors, violation incidents and complaints among many other issues from public domains like social media. To support the national digital transformation toward smart government, automating the process of monitoring, analysis and response is key to achieve much better quality and unleash services those can’t be made manually.

#### Leveraging AI for real-time capturing, analysis and cognation of citizens and community feedback can enable intelligent automation based on text mining and NLP techniques. The objective is to collect such feedback from all potential sources like official reviews, social media, citizen complains among others across all government services. Then conduct deep analysis using AI methods and graph models to discover issues in timely fashion real-time or near-real-time. The focus is given to Arabic language and Egyptian dialect to cope with the localization requirements. The expected value is to identify and bridge potential gaps between citizens & community and government for mutual benefits driving by quality services.

#### 01 - Statement of Work: The SoW provides clear definition of the problem being solved and the associated challenges and pain points coming from the business domain context. It provided the scope and specifications of the solution being delivered.
#### 02 - Project Management: Planning, executing, and controlling the project in terms of scope, budged, time, quality, resources, and team assignment. Running project delivery in Lean Agile approach for lower risk and incremental delivered value.
#### 03 - Domain Understanding: Getting deeper into the context of the relevant business domains to understand strategies, policies, drivers, challenges, pain points and desired outcomes that represent value to the business, organization, community and/or individuals.
#### 04 - Solution Framing: Analyzing the challenges, pain points and at the same time the data in a business context to come out with solution elements especially the core machine learning models so an AI solution can deliver the desired outcome.
#### 05 - MLOps Design: As a first step for the integrated pipeline for delivering ML/AI solutions, the three layers of data, ML model and code pipelines are defined and designed to address the framed AI solution with needed CI/CD setup.
#### 06 - Sourcing Data: Identifying and implementing needed procedures and components to ingest required and supportive data/metadata from different sources using appropriate patterns for batch, real-time and streaming ingestion.
#### 07 - Modeling Platform: One key asset in an ML/AI project is the computing resources needed during developing the core AI models which typically requires high performance computing infrastructure as well as suitable technology components for manipulating data and applying processing and algorithms.
#### 08 - Data Preparation: Implementing and conducting different activities on the modeling to get the data loaded, quality-checked, transformed, reasoned, and explored and provisioned as preparation for the core modeling activities.
#### 09 - Model Planning: Start point of the core modeling by researching and exploring the potential models applicable to the given elements of the framed solution typically starts with features engineering and moves one to applying different ML/AI techniques to shortlist sounding ones.
#### 10 - Model Development: For potential models shortlisted on the model planning activity, models are taken to full model building in a setup emulating desired operational setup and workload to produce evaluation metrics and diagnostics against the actual operational workload.
#### 11 - Model Evaluation: The metrics and diagnostics as well as different applied parameters are compared so that one final model can be selected as the core for the AI solution taking into consideration the model efficiency as well as performance in the context of the required business outcomes.
#### 12 - Applications Development: Designing and implementing the application needed to make the core AI model operational including end user applications, integration with data sources, Microservices, data platforms, reports, dashboards, APIs among others.
#### 13 - Production Platform: Engineering, architecting, acquiring, and implementing the computing infrastructure needed for deploying and operating the full solution including data, ML/AI model and applications in an integrated way within the organization ICT landscape of other systems.
#### 14 - Operationalization: Planning a go-live with all solution components within DevOps setup including data, ML/AI model, application code and production platform ensuring all functional and non-functional requirements are to be met.
#### 15 - MLOps Rollout: Based on the MLOPs design as well as the operationalization plan, actual components of MLOps are deployed in production with the three elements of data, ML model and application code so that CI/CD can commence.
#### 16 - Solution Delivery: Defining and applying procedures to ensure the delivered AI solution components are solid and aligned with the customer organization’s ICT operations so that the solution continuously deliver value as intended.
#### 17 - Managed Services: Setting up teaming with the customer organization to outsource all or part of the operations, support, and sustainability of the AI solution to the project team on different levels of support.
#### 18 - Project Closing: Conducting final checks and validation of the different components of the delivered AI solution and handing over to the customer organization’s IT operations team.
